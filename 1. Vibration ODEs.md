### 1.1.1 A Basic Model for Vibrations

Consider the vibrating mechanical system
$$u^{\prime \prime}+\omega^2 u=0, \quad u(0)=I, \quad u^{\prime}(0)=0, \quad t \in(0, T] \quad \quad \quad (1.1)$$
with constant amplitude $I$ and angular frequency $\omega$. The corresponsing period is $P=2\pi/\omega$, and the corresponding frequency is $f=\omega/(2\pi)$. In this system, $u(t)$ represents displacement, $u'(t)$ velocity, and $u''(t)$ acceleration. The exact solution of $(1.1)$ is $u(t)=I \cos (\omega t)$.

### 1.1.2 A Centered Finite Difference Scheme
Four steps are to follow to formulate a finite difference method for the problem $(1.1)$.

**Step 1: Discretizing the domain**

The domain is discretized by introducing a uniformly partitioned time mesh. The points in the mesh are $t_n=n \Delta t, n=0,1, \ldots ,N_t$, where $\Delta t=T/N_t$ is the constant length of the time steps. A mesh function $u^n$ for $n=0,1, \ldots, N_t$ is introduced to approximate the exact solution $u(t_n)$ at the mesh points. 
$$u^n \sim u(t_n)$$
The mesh function $u^n$ will be computed from algebraic equations derived from the differential equation problem.
