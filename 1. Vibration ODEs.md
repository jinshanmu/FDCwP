### 1.1.1 A Basic Model for Vibrations

Consider the vibrating mechanical system
$$u^{\prime \prime}+\omega^2 u=0, \quad u(0)=I, \quad u^{\prime}(0)=0, \quad t \in(0, T] \quad \quad \quad (1.1)$$
with constant amplitude $I$ and angular frequency $\omega$. The corresponsing period is $P=2\pi/\omega$, and the corresponding frequency is $f=\omega/(2\pi)$. In this system, $u(t)$ represents displacement, $u'(t)$ velocity, and $u''(t)$ acceleration. The exact solution of $(1.1)$ is $u(t)=I \cos (\omega t)$.
